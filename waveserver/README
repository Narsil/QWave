Trouble Shooting
----------------

If something went wrong and restarting the server does not help, delete commit.log, which
stores a copy of all wavelet deltas.

Do not forget to edit the waveserver.conf file.

Turn federation off by changing "federationEnabled" to false in waveserver.conf.

Federation
----------

To enable XMPP federation (currently not really working),
copy the waveserver.conf.example file to waveserver.conf
and edit it to match your settings.

Without the config file the property "federationEnabled" is false
and no XMPP connection is created. Thus, the server works as
a stand-alone wave server.

Make sure to put your certificate and private key file in the files
mentioned in waveserver.conf.

PLEASE NOTE: Federation is work in progress and COMPLETELY BROKEN.
Use this federation stuff only if you want to participate in development.
