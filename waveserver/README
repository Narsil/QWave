To enable XMPP federation (currently not really working),
copy the waveserver.conf.example file to waveserver.conf
and edit it to match your settings.

Without the config file the property "federationEnabled" is false
and no XMPP connection is created. Thus, the server works as
a stand-alone wave server.

To test federation, make sure that FedOne instances do not insist
on checking certificates. This server does not yet support this.

PLEASE NOTE: Federation is work in progress and COMPLETELY BROKEN.
Use this federation stuff only if you want to participate in development.
