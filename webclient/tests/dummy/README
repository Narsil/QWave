Running the dummy web client
============================

Configure you web server to serve "your.domain.org/wave.fcgi" via FCGI.
Therefore you need to tell the web server an IP address and port number.
This has to match the entries in your "waveserver.conf".

Restart your web server and start ./waveserver

Copy the *.html and *.js files in any directory of your web server.
deploy.sh copies it in ~/public_html for you.

Open the index.html page, enter a JID that matches your wave domain, e.g. joe@your.domain.org.
Then click on Login. You will see the JSON messages exchange between the browser and the web server.

Now use another web client (QWaveClient, FedOne console client) to create a wave.
Add joe@your.domain.org to the wave and start typing.
Now you should see that messages are arriving in the browser. These are the wavelet updates in JSON encoding.

That's it for now
